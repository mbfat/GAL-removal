why does hiding from GAL fail in exchange---
There are several reasons why hiding a user from the Global Address List (GAL) in Exchange may fail. One common reason is that the msExchHideFromAddressLists attribute is not set correctly. This attribute needs to be set to "True" in order to hide the user from the GAL. Another reason could be that the user account is not synchronized properly between on-premises Active Directory and Exchange Online, which can cause the GAL to not properly reflect the changes made on one system. Additionally, if there are errors in the Directory Synchronization process, this can also cause issues with hiding users from the GAL. Finally, it is also possible that there may be a bug or issue within Exchange itself that is causing the problem.

Another reason is when the user account is not synchronized properly between the on-premises Active Directory and Exchange Online environments. This can cause the GAL to not properly reflect the changes made on one system. Additionally, errors in the Directory Synchronization process can also cause issues with hiding users from the GAL. In some cases, this issue may also be caused by some bugs or glitches within Exchange Online.
